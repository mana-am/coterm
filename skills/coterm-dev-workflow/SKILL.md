# coterm Dev Workflow

## Tagged local dev

After making code changes, always run the reload script with a tag to build the Debug app:

```bash
./scripts/reload.sh --tag <short-tag>
```

By default, `reload.sh` builds but does not launch the app. Pass `--launch` only when you need to open it automatically.

Never run bare `xcodebuild` or open an untagged `Coterm DEV.app`. Untagged builds share the default debug socket and bundle ID with other agents, causing conflicts and stealing focus.

For CLI or socket dogfood against a tagged Debug app, use the tag-bound helper and set `COTERM_TAG`:

```bash
COTERM_TAG=<tag> scripts/coterm-debug-cli.sh list-workspaces
```

Do not use `/tmp/coterm-cli` for tagged dogfood. That symlink points at the most recently reloaded build.

When rebuilding cotermd for release/bundling, always use ReleaseFast:

```bash
cd cotermd && zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

## Initial setup

Run the setup script to initialize submodules, build GhosttyKit, and install the pbxproj normalization pre-commit hook:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

## Xcode toolchain

The team is pinned to Xcode 26.x. `.xcode-version` records the major; `coterm.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` carries `objectVersion = 60`, which is what Xcode 26 writes by default. (objectVersion 77 is reserved for projects that adopt synchronized folder groups, which coterm does not use yet. Bumping to a different value requires a deliberate team decision.)

`scripts/setup.sh` installs a tracked pre-commit hook (`scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit`) that runs `scripts/normalize-pbxproj.py` on any staged `coterm.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`, sorting the high-churn sections so Xcode's nondeterministic reordering never reaches a commit. The hook is idempotent. CI runs `scripts/check-pbxproj.sh` to enforce both the `objectVersion` pin and normalization, so anyone who skips the hook (or never ran setup) gets a clear failure on their PR.

`.xcode-version` is the single source of truth. To bump the pin: edit `.xcode-version`, open `coterm.xcodeproj` in the new Xcode (which rewrites `objectVersion` automatically when it touches the file), and add a case for the new Xcode major in `scripts/check-pbxproj.sh` mapping it to the `objectVersion` that major writes.

## Sidebar extension point (dev tagging)

Each tagged dev build gets its own ExtensionKit sidebar extension point so concurrent dev builds don't collide. Three build settings drive this:

- `COTERM_SIDEBAR_EXTENSION_POINT_ID` (default `coterm.com.emergent.app.coterm.sidebar`): the extension point identifier baked into Info.plist at build time.
- `COTERM_BUNDLE_ID_SUFFIX` (default empty): inserted into the app and appex bundle ids so a tagged extension gets a distinct identity that pkd records separately.
- `COTERM_DISPLAY_NAME_SUFFIX` (default empty): appended to the appex `CFBundleDisplayName`. The OS groups sidebar extensions by display name for the enable/disable + availability counts the host reads (`AppExtensionIdentity` exposes only `bundleIdentifier`, `localizedName`, `extensionPointIdentifier`, `id` — coterm already keys its own identity off the stable `bundleIdentifier`, but the OS-level grouping is by name). Two same-named appexes installed side by side (a base build and a tagged build) are treated as one logical extension, so toggling one perturbs the other; a per-tag display name keeps them distinct.

The host resolves its point id at runtime from the Info.plist key `CotermSidebarExtensionPointIdentifier` via `CotermSidebarExtensionPoint.identifier(in:)`. `./scripts/reload.sh --tag <tag>` scopes the host point to `coterm.com.emergent.app.debug.<tag>.coterm.sidebar`. `./scripts/reload-extension.sh --tag <tag> [--host-bundle-id <id>] [--example sample|tabs|both]` builds a matching tag-scoped sample extension, passing `COTERM_SIDEBAR_EXTENSION_POINT_ID=<host-bundle-id>.coterm.sidebar`, `COTERM_BUNDLE_ID_SUFFIX=.<tag>`, and `COTERM_DISPLAY_NAME_SUFFIX=" <tag>"`. It installs exactly what xcodebuild produced (xcodebuild ad-hoc signs with entitlements intact) — it does NOT re-sign, because a bare `codesign --force --sign -` strips the appex entitlements and the extension then drops its host XPC connection. pkd ingests the tagged copy because its bundle id is distinct. Verify with `pluginkit -m -p <host-bundle-id>.coterm.sidebar`.

To author a NEW sample extension that is tag-ready:

- appex Info.plist: `EXAppExtensionAttributes:EXExtensionPointIdentifier = $(COTERM_SIDEBAR_EXTENSION_POINT_ID)`.
- add `COTERM_SIDEBAR_EXTENSION_POINT_ID` (default `coterm.com.emergent.app.coterm.sidebar`), `COTERM_BUNDLE_ID_SUFFIX` (default empty), and `COTERM_DISPLAY_NAME_SUFFIX` (default empty) build settings to the app and appex targets in all build configs.
- `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` = `<appBase>$(COTERM_BUNDLE_ID_SUFFIX)` for the app target and `<appBase>$(COTERM_BUNDLE_ID_SUFFIX).<leaf>` for the appex (suffix before the appex leaf so the appex id stays prefixed by the app id).
- appex `INFOPLIST_KEY_CFBundleDisplayName` (or the `CFBundleDisplayName` Info.plist value) = `<Name>$(COTERM_DISPLAY_NAME_SUFFIX)`.
- it must be ad-hoc signed by xcodebuild (Info.plist bound, entitlements intact) for pkd to ingest the tagged copy; do not re-sign post-build.
