// `CotermSwiftRenderUI` (SwiftUI) packages. The app target keeps only the
// coterm-coupled action dispatch, the one piece that must reach
// `TerminalController`, and injects it into the package's view from
// `ContentView`.

/// Builds the action sink that runs interpreted sidebar buttons against the
/// live coterm command dispatcher.
///
/// `coterm(...)` commands run in-process through
/// `TerminalController.handleSocketLine(_:)` (the same worker-aware surface the
/// socket CLI uses); `log` is a debug-only no-op for now.
