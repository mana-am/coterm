/// Regression coverage for guest-side terminal sharing.
///
/// When a guest joins a collaboration session (e.g. by accepting an inbox
/// invite), the host's shared terminal opens as a mirrored pane in one of the
/// guest's workspaces. Sharing one of the guest's own terminals from that
/// workspace must route into the joined session (`.shareInWorkspaceSession`),
/// not prompt the guest to create a brand-new session. That routing is driven
/// by the workspace -> session binding recorded during the mirror open; hosts
/// get the equivalent binding when they create the session.
